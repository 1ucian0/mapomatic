# mapomatic

Automatic mapping of compiled circuits to low-noise sub-graphs

## Overview

One of the main painpoints in executing circuits on IBM Quantum hardware is finding the best qubit mapping.  For a given circuit, one typically tries to pick the best `initial_layout` for a given target system, and then SWAP maps using that set of qubits as the starting point.  However there are a couple of issues with that execution model.  First, an `initial_layout` seletected, for example with respect to the noise characteristics of the system, need not be optimal for the SWAP mapping.  In practice this leads to either low-noise layouts with extra SWAP gates inserted in the circuit, or optimally SWAP mapped circuits on (possibly) lousy qubits.  Second, there is no way to know if the system you targeted in the compilation is actually the best one to execute the compiled circuit on.  With 20+ quantum systems, it is hard to determine wich device is actually ideal for a given problem.

Mapomatic tries to tackle these issues in a different way. Mapomatic is a post-compilation routine that finds the best low noise sub-graph on which to run a circuit given one or more quantum systems as target devices.  Once compiled, a circuit has been rewritten so that its two-qubit gate structure matches that of a given sub-graph on the target system.  Mapomatic then searches for matching sub-graphs using the VF2 mapper in [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra) ([retworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx) actually), and uses a heuristic to rank them based on error rates determined by the current calibration data. That is to say that given a single target system, mapomatic will return the best set of qubits on which to execute the compiled circuit.  Or, given a list of systems, it will find the best system and set of qubits on which to run your circuit.  Given the current size of qunatum hardware, and the excellent performance of the VF2 mapper, this whole process is actually very fast.

> **IMPORTANT**: Mapomatic currently works only on circuits with single quantum and classical registers
